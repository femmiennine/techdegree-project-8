Project Instructions
To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question on Slack or in the Treehouse Community.

 3 steps
Use fetch to get and display 12 random users from The Random User Generator API
Using photos and information that the API provides, you’ll display 12 users, along with some basic information:
Image
First and Last Name
Email
City

Create a modal window that will pop up when any part of the user’s row is clicked. The following details should display in the modal window:
Image
Name
Email
Cell Number
Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, state, and postcode.
Birthdate

Structure and style the user directory so that it roughly matches the provide mockup.
Display the users in a grid or table
Add a hover state to the employee cards.
Make sure there’s a way to close the modal window

 2 steps
Add a way to filter the directory by name. To do this, you’ll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters result once they already on the page.

Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.

Final Grade: Exceeds Expectations
